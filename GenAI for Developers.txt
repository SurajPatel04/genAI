# GenAI for Developers

# Course Content

## Overview

This course provides a deep dive into Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI, covering essential concepts, frameworks, and advanced applications. Participants will learn how to build AI-powered applications, optimize workflows, and implement security best practices in AI-driven systems.

Since this a practical, project focused course, we are not going to focus on math part rather our goal is to use AI tech stack to build application/products.
